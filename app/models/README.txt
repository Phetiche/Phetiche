 Models should be here; one model (class) per DB table.
 See the RedBeanPHP documentation on models.

 Ph√©tiche wraps-up Readbean, so some things are slightly different;
 actual models (files) must be named like <model_name>_model.php
 The class itself should be named accordingly: class <model_name>_model { }
