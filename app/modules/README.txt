 Put your custom modules in this folder.
 Each module should be contained within it's own folder.
 Module folders can have sub-folders; Phétiche will look recursively and enable
 whatever your module requires.

 The difference between a library and a module is basically that a module can be "plugged" right into
 Phétiche, meaning it the Phétiche request and response object will natively be available to it. In libraries
 you must fetch them manually.
